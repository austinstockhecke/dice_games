# dice_games

Hey all!

This may be a bit of an ambitious project, but I want to create an application to include several different dice games. The reason I've decided on this is because I'd like to build a project without having to look any (or much) up. 

# current TODO
finish first game, make classes as generic as possible for reusability.
