# dice_games

Hey all!

This may be a bit of an ambitious project, but I want to create an application to include several different dice games. The reason I've decided on this is because I'd like to build a project without having to look any (or much) up. 

# current progress
yahtzee is making strong progress. currently:

* you can choose number of players, and game will loop number of plays the given amount of times (right now is 3 for testing purposes)
* you can roll up to three times, and choose which dice to keep. 
* rolls can be scored at any time. type the category you'd like to be judged
* most categories work with the exception of straights, full house, and yahtzee
* need a way to keep track of which categories are filled, and which ones aren't. 
* still need to implement calculating the final score once the game has completed
