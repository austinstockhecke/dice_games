# dice_games

Hey all!

This may be a bit of an ambitious project, but I want to create an application to include several different dice games. The reason I've decided on this is because I'd like to build a project without having to look any (or much) up. 

# current progress
yahtzee is making strong progress. currently:

* number of players can be chosen, and the game will correctly loop for 13 rounds.
* all scoring methods work flawlessly with the exception of small straight. need to figure out the logic behind differentiating 1-2-3-4 and 1-2-4-5, for instance.
* rolls can be scored at any time. type the category you'd like to be judged
* need a way to keep track of which categories are filled, and which ones aren't. 
* still need to implement calculating the final score once the game has completed. game prints a final score, but does not include bonus points (YET)
